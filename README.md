## 💫 About Me  

Hey there 👋 I’m **Saksham Nayyar**, a passionate builder who loves turning ideas into real products that *actually work*.  

🎓 I recently completed my **Master’s in Computer Science from George Mason University** and currently work as a **Software Engineer Intern at Open Learning Exchange**, contributing to their education app *myPlanet*.  
Before that, I spent **3 years at Samsung R&D Institute** as an **Software Engineer**, designing and scaling large-scale systems used by millions of Samsung device users worldwide.

### 🧩 I’m currently working on  
Creating and scaling real-world systems that merge solid engineering with practical impact: 
- 💼 **SaaSyfy**: a marketplace for AI-powered B2B SaaS tools, helping teams discover and adopt smarter software.
- 📧 **Auto Job Tracker**: Go-based Gmail → Notion pipeline that auto-logs and tracks job applications.
- 🎓 **Student Management Portal** — full-stack Spring Boot + React system with JWT auth, Kafka-based mail service, and role-based dashboards.
- 📱 **Arova**: AI-powered calorie tracker built with Jetpack Compose + Gemini API.  

### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
- Advanced microservice design — service discovery, inter-service communication (gRPC, Kafka), circuit breaking, and observability with Prometheus + Grafana.
- Distributed systems internals — caching strategies, load balancing, CAP theorem trade-offs, eventual consistency, and fault tolerance.
- Cloud-native engineering — scaling services with AWS ECS/EKS, Terraform, and CI/CD automation for production-grade reliability.
- Software leadership — writing better design docs, mentoring devs, and making trade-offs that balance velocity with long-term scalability.

### ⚡ Fun fact  
I’m training my mind and body like a soldier, waking up at 5 AM, coding, lifting, and building every damn day.  
I’m obsessed with growth, networking, and building meaningful things.
